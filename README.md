A collection of interactive web and native desktop demos exploring 3D graphics, visual design, and playful experiences. Built with Bun, TypeScript, Three.js, and Rust, the projects include an architectural explorer, a tarot reading room, a helicopter cave expedition, a music composition desk, an orbital mechanics laboratory, a digital logic laboratory, a generative canvas and stop-motion studio, an AI-assisted procedural 3D modelling studio, a 7-a-side football game, a macOS desktop companion, and a solution-engineering workbench. Each demo is a standalone application with its own source code and setup instructions. YouTube walkthroughs are included where available.

Here, “demos” means real applications that demonstrate GPT6's power to generate software and, in some cases, use GPT6 within the application itself. The apps conform to strictly defined use cases, documented in the `specs/` directory of most projects.

The repository also includes **Crosstalk**, a reusable voice control service that lets an AI explain and operate an application through its registered tools. Edificio Europa is its first integration and is available both in the browser and as a Linux native desktop executable with Crosstalk included.

Use this repository to try the demos, explore how they work, or build on their ideas. Follow the linked project READMEs for installation, development, and build instructions.

## Platform support

The browser demos are tested to run on **macOS and Linux**. They should also work on **Windows**, but have not been tested there. **NotAVirus has a native macOS app** requiring macOS 13 or later and a local **Ubuntu GNOME 50 Wayland extension**; the Ubuntu implementation and pending acceptance checks are documented in its [setup guide](./not-a-virus/README.md#ubuntu-gnome-50-build-and-run). It has no browser or Windows version.

## Run all demos

With [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed (Bun 1.4.0 for One More Match and Tracework), run from the repository root:

```sh
./run-all.sh           # Base port 3000 (default)
./run-all.sh 30000     # Base port 30000
./run-all.sh --help
```

The base port serves **both portals from one server**: the original gallery at `/` and the preview gallery at `/portal/`. Each demo uses the next port in the order below. For example, `./run-all.sh 30000` serves the portals at [http://localhost:30000/](http://localhost:30000/) and [http://localhost:30000/portal/](http://localhost:30000/portal/), with demo apps on ports **30001–30011**. Both portals automatically link to the assigned demo ports.

| Service | Port assignment | Default port |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Both portals | Base | 3000 |
| Edificio Europa | Base + 1 | 3001 |
| InfiniCave | Base + 2 | 3002 |
| Tonada | Base + 3 | 3003 |
| Tarot Spread | Base + 4 | 3004 |
| Orbital Mechanics Laboratory | Base + 5 | 3005 |
| Digital Logic Laboratory | Base + 6 | 3006 |
| Flip-slop | Base + 7 | 3007 |
| Codex Canvas | Base + 8 | 3008 |
| Assemblavatar | Base + 9 | 3009 |
| One More Match | Base + 10 | 3010 |
| Tracework | Base + 11 | 3011 |

Choose a base port from **1 to 65524**, with the entire twelve-port range available. Invalid arguments are rejected before installation or startup. Low ports may require system privileges; the default and the example above avoid them.

Before starting any servers, the launcher runs `bun install --frozen-lockfile` in `cross-talk/` and all eleven browser demos, then builds Tracework. Assemblavatar installs production dependencies and runs in production mode; Playwright is only a development test dependency. Tracework serves its built interface and API together on its assigned port. If an installation or the build fails, no servers are started.

Logs are labelled by service. Press **Ctrl+C** to stop all eleven browser demos and the single portal server; if any service exits, the launcher stops the others too. Individual applications' launch scripts and standalone default ports are unchanged.

Before starting Flip-slop, follow its [environment setup](./flip-slop/README.md#run): copy `flip-slop/example.env` to `flip-slop/.env` and set the OpenAI API key only in `.env`.

For Codex Canvas, follow its [setup instructions](./codexcanvas/README.md#run).

For Assemblavatar, follow its [setup instructions](./assemblavatar/README.md#run) for server-side `.env` configuration. Rendering uses the open Assemblavatar browser tab; no Playwright or separate Chromium installation is needed. The launcher sets `ASSEMBLAVATAR_PORT` to base + 9. See the [architecture guide](./assemblavatar/docs/architecture.md) for its generation, isolation and draft-feedback pipeline.

For One More Match, follow its [setup instructions](./one-more-match/README.md#run). The launcher runs `dev:web`. To open its Electrobun desktop window separately, run `bun run dev` from `one-more-match/`.

For Tracework, follow its [setup instructions](./tracework/README.md#run). It is included in the shared launcher. To run it separately on port 60000:

```sh
cd tracework
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
PORT=60000 bun run start
```

For Crosstalk voice control in Europa, configure `cross-talk/.env` using its [setup instructions](./cross-talk/README.md#run-europa-with-voice). The launcher installs Crosstalk's dependencies automatically. Europa loads that file and hosts the service itself, so the launcher needs no additional Crosstalk process. Without an API key, the architectural explorer remains usable through its normal controls.

For NotAVirus, follow its [platform build and run instructions](./not-a-virus/README.md). It runs independently of `run-all.sh` and does not use a web server.

### Demo portals

`./run-all.sh` serves these two pages on the same base port:

| Portal | Default address | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plain, original portal | [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) | Simple screenshot gallery; browser cards open the apps, and NotAVirus links to macOS setup. |
| New preview portal | [http://localhost:3000/portal/](http://localhost:3000/portal/) | Cards open a dialog with a YouTube walkthrough and a fuller description. Videos play in the page; demo titles and **Open demo** links open the app in a new tab. NotAVirus provides **Source and setup** for its native macOS app. |

The original [index.html](./index.html) uses a four-column desktop grid, two columns on tablets, and one on phones. It uses plain HTML, inline CSS, and relative image paths, so it needs no build or JavaScript and can also be opened directly from disk. Directly opened files use the default demo ports.

![Plain, original GPT6 Demos portal screenshot](./images/portal.png)

The new [portal/index.html](./portal/index.html) uses a light, two-column desktop gallery and one column on phones, with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Closing a preview stops its video. Embedded YouTube playback requires internet access and an HTTP address; when opening the file directly from disk, use **Watch on YouTube** instead.

To serve both portal pages without starting the apps, run one server from the repository root:

```sh
# Both http://localhost:3000/ and http://localhost:3000/portal/
bun run portal-server.ts

# Alternatively, both pages on port 30000; demo links use 30001–30011
PORT=30000 bun run portal-server.ts
```

The demo servers must still be running on the corresponding ports for app links to work. Stop a separately running portal server before starting the shared launcher on the same base port.

Browser saves are specific to each address and port. Export existing projects or saves before moving a demo to a different port, then import them at its new address.

## Native desktop: Edificio Europa

Europa can also run in a native window as one executable containing the Three.js explorer, Bun runtime, and Crosstalk service. It renders the building procedurally and omits reference photographs and remote fonts. Desktop voice uses WebSocket audio, fullscreen operates on the native window, and 4K PNG export opens a system save dialog.

Follow Europa's [compile, configure, and run instructions](./edificio-europa/README.md#native-executable-linux). Desktop settings can be shared through `$HOME/.conf/crosstalk/crosstalk.cfg` in dotenv format, or loaded from the launch directory's `.env`. The shared file must be created explicitly; launching from `edificio-europa/` does not automatically load `cross-talk/.env`.

The current target is Linux x64 with native Wayland and compatible GTK3/WebKitGTK 4.1 and audio libraries. Bun and a separate Crosstalk process are unnecessary on the runtime machine. Voice still needs an API key and network access. This is a Linux release candidate; broader platform and manual acceptance remain documented in the [native build guide](./edificio-europa/docs/native-desktop.md). `run-all.sh` continues to launch the browser demos; it does not build or launch native windows.

## Crosstalk — Conversational application control

Crosstalk adds a spoken interface to Bun web applications. [GPT-Live-1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-live/) handles speech and conversation, while GPT-6 Astra uses the application's description, current state, and registered tools to answer questions and carry out requests. Each application supplies its own knowledge and actions through an adapter. The service works with those explicit capabilities and state updates; it does not inspect the screen.

In Edificio Europa, press **Crosstalk**, allow microphone access, and try “What am I looking at?”, “Show it at sunset”, “Show me around”, or “Save this view”. Tools control camera perspectives, building and compass sides, relative orbit, lighting, automatic rotation, zoom, view reset, and 4K image downloads. Voice actions and manual controls share the same controller, keeping the scene, buttons, and AI state synchronized.

Europa also shares live camera orientation with the AI. Its entrance is the front, facing 010° using the supplied geographic reference. Try “Show me the back”, “View it from the east”, or “Move around to my right a little”. An orientation indicator tracks the camera after voice and mouse navigation.

**In browser mode, fullscreen illustrates the limits of tool access.** Fullscreen entry requires user activation, such as a recent click, which a voice request alone does not provide. When blocked, the tool reports the restriction and directs the user to the fullscreen button. Exiting fullscreen can still work by voice. The desktop executable uses native window operations for voice-controlled fullscreen. Both modes keep the conversation panel accessible in fullscreen.

The service includes validated tool arguments, interruption of camera navigation, and confirmation for image exports that were not directly requested. The OpenAI API key stays in the server or desktop host. Browser audio connects to OpenAI over WebRTC; desktop audio passes through the embedded Crosstalk host over WebSockets. Use **End conversation** to stop the microphone and voice session.

## Current demos

### Edificio Europa — Architectural explorer

An interactive, photo-based reconstruction of Edificio Europa in Valencia. Explore the building with free orbit, pan, and zoom, or use three animated camera presets. Switch between daylight, golden-hour, and blue-hour lighting, and export the current view as a 4K PNG. The model is an interpretive reconstruction rather than a measured architectural survey.

Its integrated [Crosstalk voice controls](#crosstalk--conversational-application-control) let you ask about the building, request a guided tour, and operate the explorer conversationally.

### Assemblavatar — Procedural 3D modelling studio

A local 3D modelling studio built with Bun, TypeScript, React, and Three.js. Describe an object or avatar and add reference photographs; GPT-6 Astra writes editable modelling code, builds it in an isolated runtime, inspects rendered views, and refines the geometry. Each rendered draft appears immediately and stays available in Results, including candidates that need further work. Inspect and edit objects or source, compare revisions, and export GLB, GLTF, or PNG. AI generation requires an OpenAI API key configured in the local `.env` file; realistic photo likeness remains an experimental capability.

### NotAVirus — macOS desktop companion

A native macOS desktop companion built with Rust and AppKit. The default character, gatita, is a playful tabby that follows the pointer, rolls and purrs visually while resting, and curls up to sleep. Switch to Paco for a slower, good-natured chase, Jellyfish UFO for a pulsing glide with swaying tendrils, or Living Ink for a glossy stretch-and-squash chase. Each animation pack has its own idle, movement and rest sequences. The transparent character lets clicks pass through to the apps below. Use the paw menu to pause, change character or size, import PNG/TOML packs, and quit. No network access, keystroke reading, or extra permissions are required.

### Tracework — Solution-engineering workbench

A local solution-engineering workbench built with Bun, TypeScript, React, and SQLite. Bring briefs, documents, and repository evidence together; read PDFs in the app and view or edit Markdown with syntax colouring. Turn source evidence into reviewed semantic models, explore architecture on a canvas, and record decisions and guardrails. Generate specifications, API contracts, and implementation packages, then inspect validation findings and trace changes back to their sources. Originals, citations, and accepted versions stay preserved. Manual workflows work without an API key; scoped AI tasks require an OpenAI API key configured on the server.
